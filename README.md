# R code for "randomization inference for cluster-randomized test-negative designs with applicaiton to dengue studies"

## Overview

This repo stores R code for reproducing the simulation studies and data analysis of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03379).

## R scripts

- __simulation-CR-TND.R__ R code for the first simulation study.

- __simulation-CR-TND-100rep.R__ R code for repeating the first simulation study 100 times and producing Figure 1.

- __simulation-dose-response.R__ R code for the second simulation study.

- __simulation-SW-TND.R__ R code for the third simulation study.

- __data-analysis.R__ R code for the data analysis.

## Data

The data used for simulation studies are publicly available and incorporated into the R scripts. For data analysis, the data are shared by the AWED study team and are not public. For more information on accessing the data, please see [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2030243)
